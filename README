CustomizedPSPLASH
=======
**** NOTICE: This is a customized version of PSPLASH.
I added a command line switch to enable/disable double buffer feature. 
For some old embedded systems (in my case G170 C7) double buffer doesn't work properly.
in order to disable double frame buffer, pass 'd' paramter with psplash.
Based on your Init system modify either Psplash.sh (SysV) or related script in SystemD.
Usage:
psplash -b [Other Params]
=======
PSplash is a userspace graphical boot splash screen for mainly
embedded Linux devices supporting a 16bpp or 32bpp framebuffer. It has
few dependencies (just libc), supports basic images and text and handles
rotation. Its visual look is configurable by basic source changes.

Also included is a 'client' command utility for sending information to
psplash such as boot progress information.
